                        My name is Ezra and I'm a curious developer and tech
                        enthusiast with a passion for building full-stack
                        applications and solving complex problems through code.
                        I enjoy everything from designing applications to diving
                        into hardware projects like Arduino. I also engage in
                        penetration testing from time to time, sharpening my
                        cybersecurity skills and staying ahead in the
                        ever-evolving tech landscape. Learning and creating are
                        at the core of everything I do, as I continually explore
                        new technologies and improve my craft.
